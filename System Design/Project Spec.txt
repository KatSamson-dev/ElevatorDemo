In this type of file I would store the base spec of the project that should outline the base requirements and solution design including sequence diagrams,
data models, process flows etc with the idea to cover all levels of the C4 model to a degree appropriate to the solution.
Though in a real world scenario this would be stored on a KMS and linked to the ADO board however these specs are useful for outlining projects before implementation
begins and to better educate user stories that are added.
